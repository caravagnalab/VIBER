\usage{
plot_2D(
  x,
  d1,
  d2,
  cex = 1,
  alpha = 0.3,
  cut_zeroes = TRUE,
  binning_n = NA,
  binning_b = NA,
  downsample = Inf,
  colors = NA,
  bin_params = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class 'vb_bmm'.}

\item{d1}{The name of the dimension to plot (x-axis).}

\item{d2}{The name of the dimension to plot (y-axis).}

\item{cex}{Cex of the points and the overall plot.}

\item{alpha}{Alpha of the points.}

\item{binning_n}{This parameter goes with \code{binning_b}. If both \code{NA}, 
no binnig is computed. If an integer value points are binned in a grid of size
defined by \code{binning_b}, and up to \code{binning_n} points are sampled 
per bin according to each cluster whose points map inside the bin.}

\item{binning_b}{This parameter goes with \code{binning_n}. If both \code{NA}, 
no binning is computed. If a real valuem points are binned in a grid of size
\code{binning_b} by \code{binning_b}.}

\item{downsample}{Maximun number of points to plot. Default is \code{Inf}, no downsampling.}

\item{colors}{Optional vector of colors, default (\code{NA}) are \code{ggplot} colors.}

\item{bin_params}{If \code{TRUE} it adds also a point to show the fit Binomial success probabilities.}

\item{cut_zeros}{If \code{TRUE}, remove points that are 0 in both dimensions.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object.
}
\description{
Plot the fit for two dimensions, one against the other. Colour each point
(defined as the ratio of sucesses over trail) according to the clustering assignments.
